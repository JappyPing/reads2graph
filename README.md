reads2graph is a practical method for constructing an edit-distance-based read graph for a short-read sequencing dataset via minimizer and order min hash bucketing and graph traversal.

## Installation
### From bioconda
#### Create an environment and install reads2graph via conda
```
conda create -n reads2graph-env
conda activate reads2graph-env
conda install bioconda::reads2graph
```

### From source
#### Create an environment and Install dependencies via conda
```
conda create -n reads2graph-env
conda activate reads2graph-env
conda install cmake==3.27.6 gxx_linux-64==13.2.0 sharg==1.1.1 seqan3==3.3.0 boost==1.82.0 openmp==8.0.1
```
#### Compile read2graph
```
git clone https://github.com/Jappy0/reads2graph.git
cd reads2graph
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Example

### Installing reads2graph from source codes
```
cd ..
cd example
../bin/reads2graph -i ./data/SRR1543965.umi.fasta -o ./ -x 2 -n 1 -p 64 -k 4 --window_number 2 --omh_times 4 --omh_k 4
```
### Installing reads2graph from bioconda
download the example data(SRR1543965.umi.fasta) from this repo
```
wget https://github.com/Jappy0/reads2graph/blob/main/example/data/SRR1543965.umi.fasta
```
```
reads2graph -i ./SRR1543965.umi.fasta -o ./ -x 2 -n 1 -p 64 -k 4 --window_number 2 --omh_times 4 --omh_k 4
```
### Expected results
Note: The date, time, and commands will reflect the current state when you execute `reads2graph'. The example process will be finished in about 4 minutes.
